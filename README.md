# Service Pricing By Time
A sales funnel built with TailwindCSS. 

The user enters their contact information into the form and then an Infusionsoft contact is created and opted-in to marketing.
The contact will then be directed to a confirmation page and tagged as a prospective client. A follow-up sequence is setup in the campaign to send out the guide booklet and to promote the Cost Per Hour coaching page (source located at the cost-per-hour repo).
